# EQUILIBRIUM – The Ledger of Balance

Why we exchange. Why it flows. Why it’s fair.

EQUILIBRIUM is the system’s conscience of value —  
the way demand, contribution, and need find harmony.

Not a market. Not control. But a felt balance  
between what is given, what is needed, and what sustains.

## WHAT

EQUILIBRIUM is the symbolic economy of a DAO —  
measuring not just money, but meaning and flow.

| Element       | Description                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Value Signal   | What is honored and seen as meaningful                |
| Contribution   | What is given — time, care, skill, presence           |
| Demand         | What is needed — friction, energy, desire             |
| Exchange       | Flows of reciprocity — symbolic or financial          |
| Regeneration   | Balancing cost with renewal                          |

## HOW

EQUILIBRIUM surfaces through:

- Contribution registries
- Reward flows (tokens, attention, acknowledgment)
- Demand maps (what the system needs next)
- Symbolic economic metrics (pulse of value perception)

Balance is not a number — it’s a feeling of fit.
