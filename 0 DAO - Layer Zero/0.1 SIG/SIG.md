# SIG — UNIVERSE.DAO

A new paradigm of SIGNATURE.  
Censorship-resistant. Human-readable. Cryptographically verifiable.  
Resilient against AI forgery and quantum disruption.  

<br>

## WHY

In a decentralized world, authorship must be provable —  
across time, across platforms, and across consensus.

<br>

## WHAT

Social posts or public declarations  
DAO votes, election outcomes, or governance records  
Git commits and code pushes  
Proposals, manifestos, community charters  
Videos or music  
Symbolic or visual watermarks  

If it can be written, it can be signed.  
If it can be signed, it can be verified.

<br>

## HOW

If we care about truth, we must be ready to prove it  
in an age shaped by AI and fractured by quantum change.  

The ritual is forming and coming soon.
