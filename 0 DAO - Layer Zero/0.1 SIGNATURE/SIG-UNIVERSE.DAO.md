# SIG-UNIVERSE.DAO

A new paradigm of SIGNATURE.
 
Censorship-resistant. Human-readable. Cryptographically verifiable.
  
Resilient against AI forgery and quantum disruption.

---

<br>

## WHY

In a decentralized world, authorship must be provable —  
across time, across platforms, and across consensus.

---

<br>

## WHAT

- Social posts or public declarations  
- DAO votes, election outcomes, or governance records  
- Git commits and code pushes  
- Proposals, manifestos, community charters  
- Videos or music  
- Symbolic or visual watermarks

> If it can be written, it can be signed.  
> If it can be signed, it can be verified.

## HOW

Each Canonical Hashed Message includes:

- **Signature authenticity proof** (`C-HASH`)  
- **Canonical message hash path** (`ChM-HASH`)  
- **Quorum consensus traceability** via linked signer proofs  

Messages are fully human-readable and manually verifiable —  
no special tools, platforms, or wallets required.

For full protocol mechanics, see:  
[UNIVERSE-DAO/SIG/README](https://github.com/UNIVERSE-DAO/SIG/blob/main/README.md)

## OPTIONS

A browser-based verifier UI visualizes Canonical Hashed Message status and quorum:   
Open: [Canonical Hashed Message - ChM Verifier UI](https://universe-dao.github.io/SIG/index.html)

The tool is optional. Every message and signature remains portable, inspectable, and self-verifying.

## CONCLUSION

SIG-UNIVERSE.DAO is not just a protocol — it’s a commitment.  
To truth over time. To authorship without platforms. To memory that resists silence.

Whether you're signing a code commit or a cultural moment,  
you now have a way to prove it — without asking for permission.

---
---
If we care about truth, we must be ready to prove it — in a world shaped by AI and fractured by quantum change.
