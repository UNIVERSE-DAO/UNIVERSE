# UIP — UNIVERSE Improvement Proposal

The UIP system defines the core mechanics for protocol evolution,  
including proposal structure, governance flow, and upgrade authorization.

This framework is currently under active development and protected  
during **Phase 1: BUIDL** to ensure coherence and security.

Until decentralization becomes operational,  
this directory remains intentionally minimal and partially private.

A public UIP process will be released at the beginning of **Phase 2: BIG BANG
