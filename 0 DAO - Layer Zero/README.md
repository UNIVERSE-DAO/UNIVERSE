# 🤔 Strange GitHub CodeX?

This repository defines **Layer 0**.

Layer 0 is the human layer — the shared codex that comes **before** code, models, interfaces, or governance mechanics.

As software and AI scale, code becomes a black box.  
Meaning disappears first. Accountability second.

Layer 0 exists to prevent that.

## CODE-X

Before anything is executed, there must be:
- a shared language of intent,
- a legible ethic,
- a frame all humans can audit, without permission.

Here, philosophy functions as protocol.  
Words precede code the way keys precede ownership.

If code becomes law,  
**CODE-X is the constitution.**

## Crypto-Native

- Consensus before execution  
- Legitimacy before optimization  
- Sovereignty before scale  

This layer cannot be optimized without being destroyed.

## Why Text, Not Code

If you expected code and found language, that is not absence — it is defense.

Code can be forked.  
The codex must not.

## Scope

- MEME_OS ≠ D-UI  
- MEME_OS = prerequisite  

Layer 0 operates at **#ai_ethics × #ai_guidance**.

Before machines decide,  
humans decide together.
