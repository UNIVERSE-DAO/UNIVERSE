# 🌐 UNIVERSE ALIGNMENT MAP

_This is a living audit of the symbolic structure of UNIVERSE — tracking the state, phase, and philosophical alignment of each module._

Every line reflects a vow to clarity, a pattern of truth, and a living record of shared responsibility.

## ✅ STATUS & ALIGNMENT LEGEND

### Alignment

| Symbol   | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| ✅✅       | Fully aligned — content and all references reviewed and matched. |

### Status

| Symbol         | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| 📘 Live         | Published and active document. |
| 📎 Placeholder  | Exists but not yet written or deployed. |
| 🔐 Protected    | Gated by phase, DAO vote, or symbolic unlock. |
| ♾️ Eternal      | Untouchable — core to protocol truth and structure. |

## 🧬 CORE ALIGNMENT MATRIX

Each document is compared against the following 10 symbolic values:

| Metric                  | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Philosophical Consistency | Reflects values from `PHILOSOPHY.md` — truth, sovereignty, well-being. |
| Symbolic Logic           | Uses proper structure and naming from `GUIDE-STRUCTURE.md`. |
| System Integration       | Linked from `README`, `ROADMAP`, or project-wide maps. |
| Narrative Alignment      | Matches language and intention from core docs. |
| Role Inclusivity         | Supports contribution by devs, artists, philosophers, governors. |
| Phase Logic              | Located correctly in the lunar phase roadmap (🌒 → 🌑). |
| Governance Awareness     | Aware of DAO permissions, proposals, symbolic unlocks. |
| License/Ethics Bound     | Respects terms in `LICENSE.md` (UNIVERSE.4ALL). |
| Symbolic Grammar         | Consistent with terms in `GLOSSARY.md`. |
| Well-being Alignment     | Prioritizes societal, spiritual, and planetary health. |
