##SOUL-MAP
_This is a living audit of the symbolic structure of UNIVERSE — tracking the state, phase, and philosophical alignment of each module._

Every line reflects a vow to clarity, a pattern of truth, and a living record of shared responsibility.

## ✅ STATUS & ALIGNMENT LEGEND

### Alignment

| Symbol   | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| ✅✅       | Fully aligned — content and all references reviewed and matched. |
| ✅         | Internally aligned — content reviewed, references not fully audited. |
| 🔗✅       | Symbolically referenced — content not yet reviewed. |
| ⚠️         | Needs review — incomplete, unclear, or possibly misaligned. |

### Status

| Symbol         | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| 📘 Live         | Published and active document. |
| 📎 Placeholder  | Exists but not yet written or deployed. |
| 🔐 Protected    | Gated by phase, DAO vote, or symbolic unlock. |
| ♾️ Eternal      | Untouchable — core to protocol truth and structure. |

## 🧬 CORE ALIGNMENT MATRIX

Each document is compared against the following 10 symbolic values:

| Metric                  | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Philosophical Consistency** | Reflects values from `PHILOSOPHY.md` — truth, sovereignty, well-being. |
| **Symbolic Logic**       | Uses proper structure and naming from `GUIDE-STRUCTURE.md`. |
| **System Integration**   | Linked from `README`, `ROADMAP`, or project-wide maps. |
| **Narrative Alignment**  | Matches language and intention from core docs. |
| **Role Inclusivity**     | Supports contribution by devs, artists, philosophers, governors. |
| **Phase Logic**          | Located correctly in the lunar phase roadmap (🌒 → 🌑). |
| **Governance Awareness** | Aware of DAO permissions, proposals, symbolic unlocks. |
| **License/Ethics Bound** | Respects terms in `LICENSE.md` (UNIVERSE.4ALL). |
| **Symbolic Grammar**     | Consistent with terms in `GLOSSARY.md`. |
| **Well-being Alignment** | Prioritizes societal, spiritual, and planetary health. |

> 🌀 Matrix Updated: 2025-04-14  
> - 🔺 Added: "Well-being Alignment" → from `PHILOSOPHY.md` v0.1.2  
> - 🔸 Refined: "Governance Awareness" → includes coercion-awareness clause  
> - Metrics increased: 9 → 10

1. **Add New Document**
   - Add a row in the audit table
   - Log version + review in transcript below
   - If it alters alignment values, update the matrix log (above)

2. **Review Existing Document**
   - Compare to the Core Matrix
   - Update Alignment (✅ → ✅✅)
   - Update version and Matrix Impact if values shift

3. **Matrix Impact Types**

| Symbol   | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| 🔹 Supplement | Adds depth, no change to core matrix |
| 🔸 Clarifier | Refines or updates an existing metric |
| 🔺 Shifter   | Adds or alters a metric — protocol soul changes |
