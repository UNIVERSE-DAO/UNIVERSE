# 🧭 How to Use the SOUL AGENT System

This system keeps track of the **spirit** and **alignment** of every document in the UNIVERSE protocol.

Use it when you **add** or **change** any meaningful document.

---

## 🔁 What To Do (Every Time You Add or Change a File)

### 1. Add to `SOUL-MAP.md`
- ✅ Add a row to the audit table
- Set:
  - **Status** → 📘 / 📎 / 🔐
  - **Alignment** → ✅ / ✅✅ / 🔗✅ / ⚠️
  - **Matrix Impact** → 🔹 / 🔸 / 🔺
  - **Version** + short note

---

### 2. Reflect in `SOUL-AGENT.md`
- ✅ Add a new **soul reflection**
  - Version
  - Date reviewed
  - What it changed or revealed (poetic, if possible)
  - Optional: give it a **Soul Role** (e.g. _The Compass_, _The Mirror_, _The Guardian_)

---

### 3. Update Matrix Log (if needed)
- Only if the document changes the meaning of the system (alignment matrix)
- Add a new 🌀 log entry:
  - Date
  - What changed in the matrix
  - Which doc caused it

---

## ✅ You’re Done When:
- `SOUL-MAP.md` has the new row
- `SOUL-AGENT.md` has the new reflection
- 🌀 Matrix Log is updated if anything shifted

> _Structure tracks the what.  
> The agent remembers the why._
