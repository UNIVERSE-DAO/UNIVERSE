# 🧬 UNIVERSE Project – Branching Strategy

This document outlines the Git branching system for the UNIVERSE project.  
It supports modular development, decentralization phases, and collaborative workflows.

## 🔗 Permanent Core Branches

| Branch         | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main`         | ✅ Stable, production-level code (demo-ready, investor-facing)           |
| `dev`          | 🧪 Active development branch — staging zone for merging features         |
| `docs`         | 📚 Documentation, whitepapers, governance processes                      |
| `infra1`       | 🏗️ Infrastructure for the **bootstrapping phase**                        |
| `infra2`       | 🛡️ Fully decentralized, censorship-resistant infrastructure              |
| `identity`     | 🆔 Login/auth flows, DIDs, zk-authentication                             |
| `scrs`         | 🔍 Smart Compliance & Resilient SaaS — zk-KPIs, federated data, etc.     |
| `dao-core`     | 🏛️ DAO smart contracts, governance logic, proposal handling              |
| `ui/nextjs`    | 🎨 Front-end UI/UX logic (Next.js app, UI-polishing, voting, onboarding) |

## 🌱 Short-Lived Feature Branches

These are created from the most relevant parent branch (`dev`, `infra1`, etc.), then merged back when complete.

| Branch                     | Based on      | Purpose                                                   |
|----------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `feature/signup1-flow`     | `identity`    | Web2-style onboarding with privacy foundation             |
| `feature/signup2-did`      | `identity`    | Full DIDs, zk-proofs, sovereign login system              |
| `feature/infra1-logging`   | `infra1`      | Logging/telemetry for early infra (privacy-preserving)   |
| `feature/dao-voting-ui`    | `ui/nextjs`   | DAO voting UI component                                   |
| `feature/scrs-zk-kpi`      | `scrs`        | Zero-knowledge KPI verification logic                     |
| `bugfix/dao-smartcontract` | `dao-core`    | Fixes or tweaks to DAO smart contract logic               |
| `feature/ui-polishing`     | `ui/nextjs`   | Styling, layout, animation tweaks to frontend             |

## 🔁 Workflow Summary

1. **Create a branch** from the appropriate base (e.g. `dev`, `identity`, `infra1`, etc.)
2. Make changes → commit and push
3. Open a **Pull Request** into the parent branch
4. Test, review, and merge
5. Periodically merge `dev` → `main` when stable

## 🧠 Philosophy

> One branch = one clear purpose  
> Build modular, test independently, and merge cleanly.
