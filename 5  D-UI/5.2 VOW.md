# VOW to CARE

> _Responsibility is essential for the visualization of human progress._

<br>

## WHY

In regenerative systems, the key is to create a clear framework that invites and promotes responsibility.

The VOW is one of the self-reinforcing reward mechanisms:  
Even at the most basic level — when you take care and responsibility for yourself,  
and become aware of your surroundings — it rewards you in the most profound way.  

> _Awareness becomes a powerful tool and a milestone in mastering the Infinite Game._
