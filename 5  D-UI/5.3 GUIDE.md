# GUIDE – The Coordination of Civic Alignment

Why we organize. Why we choose. Why it matters.

GUIDE is the logic-layer of sovereignty —  
the structure through which collective will becomes real.

It transforms shared intent into action,  
and protects coherence through principled decision-making.

## WHAT

GUIDE holds the operational intelligence of a DAO —  
the architecture of proposals, agreements, and aligned evolution.

| Function     | Description                                           |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Consent      | Structured choice-making that reflects collective will |
| Proposal     | Encoded signal of intention and change                |
| Alignment    | Shared criteria for legitimacy and coherence          |
| Flow         | Governance loops that evolve alongside the system     |
| Protection   | Filters to safeguard integrity and clarity            |

## HOW

GUIDE is not control — it is clarity.  
It emerges through trusted flows and rituals of participation.

Governance interfaces include:

- Proposal submissions and review
- Agreement and veto rituals
- Alignment thresholds (via VOW)
- Cyclical updates (via MOMENTUM)

When governance aligns with belief — power flows cleanly.
