# SUCCESS – The Pulse of Meaning

Why we evolve. Why it feels right. Why we continue.

SUCCESS is not a scoreboard — it’s a signal.  
It reflects resonance, joy, impact, and aligned direction.

It tracks what matters — not just what grows.

## WHAT

SUCCESS reveals whether we are living the vision —  
and if our rituals, contributions, and culture reflect our values.

| Signal         | Description                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Joy            | Emotional feedback — collective vitality              |
| Purpose        | Clarity of contribution and personal alignment        |
| Momentum       | Shared progress and symbolic wins                     |
| Recognition    | Gratitude, visibility, and contribution celebration   |
| Rhythm         | Cycles of renewal and collective narrative            |

## HOW

SUCCESS is surfaced through symbolic metrics and social sensing:

- Ritual reflections
- Contribution reviews
- Pulse reports (via MOMENTUM)
- Gratitude cycles and signal syncs

It doesn’t prove value — it reveals coherence.
