# 📜 CHANGELOG  
All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

---

## [0.1.2] – 2025-04-01

### ✅ CI/CD Integration & Pipeline Validation  
- Implemented initial GitHub Actions pipeline (`ci-cd.yml`) for backend test runs  
- Fixed runner error due to misnamed folder (`6 backend` → `backend`)  
- Confirmed successful CI test run using placeholder `npm test` command  
- Adjusted `ci-cd.yml` to monitor `pull_request` events for `main` and `develop`

### 📁 Modular Structure Finalization  
- Confirmed removal of redundant `frontend/` folder  
- Validated full hierarchy across repo (folders 0 to 8 and symbolic markers)  
- Verified alignment between file structure, `PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md`, and CI paths

### 🔐 Protected IP Handling  
- Maintained placeholder + protected markers (`#SignUp1.md`, `-README.md`)  
- Validated visibility strategy for public/investor-safe access  
- Set the groundwork for linking Git submodules (e.g. `dao-contracts`, `auth-core`)

### 📦 Repository Hygiene  
- Cleaned backend placeholder config (`package.json`)  
- Maintained minimal valid structure for testing environment  
- Re-tested pipeline after restructure and backend renaming

> 🚀 Next Step: Begin rolling out branch strategy (e.g. `scrs`, `identity`, `infra1`) as per `BRANCHING-STRATEGY.md`  
> Plan MVP logic in `backend`, populate `#SignUp1`, `#KPI`, and finalize GitHub CI config for full modular test support

## [0.1.1] – 2025-04-01

### 🔨 Structure Cleanup & UI Clarification  
- ✅ Removed unused `6 frontend/` folder to reduce redundancy  
- ✅ Confirmed `7 nextjs-app/` as the primary UI module  
- 🧭 Clarified future potential for `frontend/` as a design system if needed

### 📂 Updated Project Layout  
- Finalized symbolic structure (`0 #DAO - The Layer Zero`, `1 #MOMENTUM`, etc.)  
- Verified alignment with `PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md` and `BRANCHING-STRATEGY.md`

### 🛠 Ready for Branch Rollout  
- Confirmed that `dev` branch is the starting point for modular branches  
- Staged rollout plan: `identity`, `infra1`, `scrs`, `ui/nextjs`, etc.

> ✅ Next step: Begin creating branches and linking protected submodules

## [0.1.0] – 2025-04-01

### 🆕 Added  
- Created full **modular folder structure** following staged decentralization roadmap  
- Numbered all top-level modules for logical hierarchy:  
  - `1 #DAO/`, `2 MINDFORGER/`, `3 identity/`, `4 infra/`, etc.  
- Added nested subfolders for:  
  - `1.1 contracts/`, `1.2 proposals/`, `1.3 voting/`  
  - `3.1 #SignUp1/`, `3.2 #SignUp2/`  
- Introduced placeholder files (`-README.md`, `-package.json`) for protected or future modules  
- Cleaned up `.gitignore`, `.github/`, and special files to stay unnumbered  
- Updated `README.md` with live folder structure and purpose-based descriptions

### 🛠️ Refactored  
- Renamed several folders to match roadmap hierarchy (e.g. `infra → 4 infra`, `backend → 5 backend`)  
- Removed or relocated unused boilerplate files to improve clarity

### 🧭 Next Step  
- Begin **implementing the branching strategy** using the documented `BRANCHING-STRATEGY.md`  
  - Create base branches: `main`, `dev`, `docs`, `infra1`, etc.  
  - Set up consistent naming for feature branches (e.g. `feature/signup1-flow`)
