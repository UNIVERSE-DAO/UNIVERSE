# MOMENTUM

_Where Culture Meets Protocol_  
_Where Memes Become Movement_

MOMENTUM is the cultural ignition layer of UNIVERSE.  
It is not a campaign — it’s a **memetic field of alignment**.

> This is where curiosity is sparked, not instructed.  
> Where the soul of the protocol is felt — before it is understood.

## Purpose

To transmit clarity through symbols.  
To reflect truth through humor, rhythm, and resonance.  
To seed participation without coercion.

MOMENTUM makes philosophy viral —  
And makes contribution a cultural instinct.

## Meme as OS

Memes are not entertainment.  
They are **semiotic carriers of alignment**.

- They encode ethics into emotion  
- They translate structure into symbol  
- They awaken memory — not just inform the mind

> A meme is a mirror, a signal, a spark.

## UNIVERSE.MEME

The portal to the protocol's soul.  
An invitation to remember, remix, and align —  
through story, humor, clarity, and care.

> You don’t follow a meme.  
> You resonate with it.

## The Multiplayer Engine (coming soon)

A resonance interface for symbolic coordination.  
Not a task board — a pulse amplifier.

It listens to your energy  
and ripples it toward where it matters most.

**Make memes like they matter.**  
Because in UNIVERSE — they do.
