# DAOIST — Layer Zer0

**Layer Zer0** is the root of social consensus in the UNIVERSE protocol —  
the layer beneath the code, where identity, trust, and shared intent are formed.

Participation doesn’t begin with smart contracts.  
It begins with alignment.

## What is Layer Zer0?

In Web3, **Layer 0** is the base layer that everything else builds on.  
In UNIVERSE, it is the **ritual foundation** —  
where we define why the system exists, and who is aligned to shape it.

## DAOIST

- **DAO** → From Chinese philosophy: the natural order, the cosmic flow, the way things harmonize without force  
- **-IST** → One who practices, embodies, or lives a way  

**DAOIST** = **The Journey Is the UNIVERSE Goal**

<br>

In UNIVERSE, a DAOIST is more than a follower.  
They are a **ritualized contributor** to a symbolic protocol —  
one who acts with intention, contributes through story and structure,  
and participates in governance without domination.

## Hidden in Plain Sight

And of course, the joke...<br>
DAOIST rhymes with **Taoist** — and that’s no accident.  
It reminds us that this protocol isn’t just technical.  
It’s philosophical, ethical, and even spiritual.

To walk this path is to **align before you build**.  
To shape the system is to first understand its soul.
