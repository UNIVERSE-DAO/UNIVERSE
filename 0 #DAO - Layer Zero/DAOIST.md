## Symbolic Meaning in the UNIVERSE Protocol

In UNIVERSE, a DAOIST is more than a follower.  
They are a ritualized contributor — an intentional actor within a symbolic protocol.

A DAOIST:

- Acts with intention  
- Contributes through structure, story, and symbol  
- Participates with responsibility and self-governance  
- Holds sovereignty as sacred  
- Upholds truth as a non-negotiable foundation  

To be a DAOIST is to shape the protocol — not just through code, but through clarity.
