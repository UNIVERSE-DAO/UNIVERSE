# DAOIST — Layer Zer0

<br>

**Layer Zer0** is the root of social consensus in the UNIVERSE protocol —  
the layer beneath the code, where identity, trust, and shared intent are formed.

Participation doesn’t begin with smart contracts.  
It begins with **alignment**.

<br>

## What is Layer Zer0?

In Web3, Layer 0 is the foundational layer everything else builds upon.  
In UNIVERSE, it is the **ritual foundation** —  
where we define *why* the system exists, and *who* is aligned to shape it.

> Layer Zer0 isn’t just technical — it’s about meaning.  
> It’s the shared soul before shared structure.
