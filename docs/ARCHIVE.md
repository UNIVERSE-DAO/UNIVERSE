# 🗃️ Backup & Archive Strategy

UNIVERSE maintains regular backups to ensure resilience, continuity, and alignment with its long-term decentralization goals.

## 🧩 Backup Layers

- **Shadow Git Repository**  
  A full mirror of this repository exists under a separate, private GitHub account to safeguard against loss or censorship.

- **Offline Versioned Archives (.zip)**  
  Key development checkpoints are exported as `.zip` snapshots (without Git history) and stored securely offline.

## 📅 Archive Log

| Date       | Version      | Stage             | Notes                          |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| 2025-04-03 | v0.1.0.zip   | Initial Structure | DAO layer set, layout stable   |
| ...        | ...          | ...               | ...                             |

> Snapshots include active code, docs, and public assets, but exclude `.env`, secrets, and Git history.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

> *Preserving the code is preserving the mission.*  
The archive acts as both a safety net and a symbol of long-term integrity.
