### ARCHITECTURE – SYSTEMS

Overview of the modules and governance structure that compose UNIVERSE.


| **Module** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| [`#Infra1`](#infra1) | Privately hosted infrastructure to enable efficient adoption and usability |
| [`#SignUp1`](#signup1) | Web2-compatible login flow that bridges users into sovereign systems |
| [`#SignUp2`](#signup2) | Transition to full Sovereign Identity using DIDs and zk-auth protocols |
| [`#Infra2`](#infra2) | Fully decentralized, censorship-resistant backend for resilient coordination |
| [`#D-UI`](#d-ui) | Decentralized frontends that visualize truth, alignment, and shared well-being |
| [`#SCRS`](#scrs) | Smart Compliance through zk-proofs — enabling verifiability without exposure |
| [`#UIP`](#uip) | UNIVERSE Improvement Proposal — from dev-led updates to autonomous governance |

> Each module can be explored at the right time.

## Governance Phases: The DAO’s Role in the Infinite Game

<br>

**Phase 1: DAO-Led Development**  
- Build and govern the privacy-first infrastructure

<br>

**Phase 2: Progressive Decentralization**  
- Shift governance to federated decision-making & decentralized smart contracts

<br>

**Phase 3: DAO as a Guardian  — Proposes, Aligns, Protects** 
- UNIVERSE.DAO does not control operations but votes on and implements key upgrades  
- Ensures alignment with decentralization & privacy principles  
- Intervenes only in existential threats or to approve critical feature expansions

<br>

>✅ **The DAO’s Role**: To steward decentralization, align upgrades, and protect the protocol’s purpose.
