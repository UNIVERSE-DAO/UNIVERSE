### ARCHITECTURE – SYSTEMS

Overview of the modules and governance structure that compose UNIVERSE.


| **Module** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| [`#Infra1`](#infra1) | Privately hosted infrastructure to enable efficient adoption and usability |
| [`#SignUp1`](#signup1) | Web2-compatible login flow that bridges users into sovereign systems |
| [`#SignUp2`](#signup2) | Transition to full Sovereign Identity using DIDs and zk-auth protocols |
| [`#Infra2`](#infra2) | Fully decentralized, censorship-resistant backend for resilient coordination |
| [`#D-UI`](#d-ui) | Decentralized frontends that visualize truth, alignment, and shared well-being |
| [`#SCRS`](#scrs) | Smart Compliance through zk-proofs — enabling verifiability without exposure |
| [`#UIP`](#uip) | UNIVERSE Improvement Proposal — from dev-led updates to autonomous governance |

## Governance Phases: The DAO’s Role in the Infinite Game

<br>

**Phase 1: DAO-Led Development**  
_- Build and govern the protected, privacy-first infrastructure_

<br>

**Phase 2: Progressive Decentralization**  
_- Shift governance to federated decision-making & decentralized smart contracts_

<br>

**Phase 3: DAO as a Guardian  — Proposes, Aligns, Protects** <br> 
_- The UNIVERSE.DAO aligns intent, signals consent, and upvotes proposals._ <br> 

<br>

>✅ **The DAO’s Role**: To steward decentralization, align upgrades, and protect the protocol’s purpose.
