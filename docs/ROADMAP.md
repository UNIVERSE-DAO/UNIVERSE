# UNIVERSE â€“ Development Phases Â· Glossary

UNIVERSE unfolds through intentional development phases.  
Some stages are public, others remain protected until key thresholds are met â€”  
such as decentralized UI operation and contributor federation.

## Phase Overview

### ðŸŒ’ Phase 0 â€” Backbone BUIDL  
Foundational scaffolding, symbolic structure, and system initialization.

- `#DAO` â€” Governance initiation  
- `#MOMENTUM` â€” Participation flow  
- `#MINDFORGER` â€” Interactive ethics and alignment reflection

---

### ðŸŒ“ Phase 1 â€” Pre Big-Bang  
Protected ideation, modular deployment, and internal synchronization.

- `#Infra1` â€” Hosted backbone  
- `#SignUp1` â€” Entry-level sovereign access  
- `#KPI-1` â€” Initial key metrics

---

### ðŸŒ• Phase 2 â€” Big Bang  
Public ignition of key modules and contributor expansion.  
The moment UNIVERSE begins to operate beyond its origin node.

- `#Infra2` â€” Fully decentralized backend infrastructure  
- `#SignUp2` â€” Full sovereign identity (DIDs + zk-auth)  
- `#SCRS` â€” Smart Compliance and Resilient Services  
- `#TTE` â€” The Truth Engine

---

### ðŸŒ‘ Phase 3 â€” Black Hole  
Core protocol deepening, advanced privacy tools, and AI-aligned infrastructure.

- `#D-UI` â€” Decentralized UI / Distributed nodes  
- `#THG` â€” The Holy Grail  
- `#PP` â€” Protection Protocol  
- `#DSM` â€” Dark Side of the Moon (*fixing social media*)
