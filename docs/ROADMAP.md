# ROADMAP – MILESTONES

> ### UNIVERSE – Development Phases · Glossary

---
<br>

## 🌒 Phase 0 — Backbone BUIDL  
>Foundational scaffolding, symbolic structure, and system initialization.

- `#DAO` — Governance initiation  
- `#MOMENTUM` — Participation flow  
- `#MINDFORGER` — Interactive ethics and alignment reflection

---

<br>

## 🌓 Phase 1 — Pre Big-Bang  
>Protected ideation, modular deployment, and internal synchronization.

- `#Infra1` — Hosted backbone  
- `#SignUp1` — Entry-level sovereign access  
- `#KPI-1` — Initial key metrics

---

<br>

## 🌕 Phase 2 — Big Bang  
>Public ignition of key modules and contributor expansion.  

- `#Infra2` — Fully decentralized backend infrastructure  
- `#SignUp2` — Full sovereign identity (DIDs + zk-auth)  
- `#SCRS` — Smart Compliance and Resilient Services  
- `#TTE` — The Truth Engine

---

<br>

## 🌑 Phase 3 — Black Hole  
>Core protocol deepening, advanced privacy tools, and AI-aligned infrastructure.

- `#D-UI` — Decentralized UI / Distributed nodes  
- `#THG` — The Holy Grail  
- `#PP` — Protection Protocol  
- `#DSM` — Dark Side of the Moon (*fixing social media*)  
- `#CPI` — Cipher Punk Ideology Index

>Each symbol marks a living module —  
>Some already unfolding in public view, others still protected, awaiting shared authorship.  
>
>_When readiness meets resonance — they reveal themselves._
