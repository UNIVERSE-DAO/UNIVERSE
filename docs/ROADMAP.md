# 🛰️ UNIVERSE – Development Phases · Glossary

UNIVERSE unfolds through intentional development phases.  
Some stages are public, others remain protected until key thresholds are met —  
such as decentralized UI operation and contributor federation.

## 🚧 Phase Overview

---

### 🧱 Phase 0 — Backbone BUIDL  
Foundational structure, symbolic systems, and initialization.

- `#DAO`  
- `#MOMENTUM`  
- `#MINDFORGER`

### 🌘 Phase 1 — Pre Big-Bang  
Protected ideation, modular implementation, and internal alignment.

- `#infra1`  
- `#SignUp1`  
- `#KPI-1`

---

### 🌌 Phase 2 — Big Bang  
Public ignition of key modules and contributor onboarding.  
The moment UNIVERSE begins to operate beyond its original vessel.

- `#CCC`  
- `#D-UI` ← Distributed UI system (nodes begin serving interface modules)  
- `#SCRS`  
- `#THG`  
- `#DDI`

> First public MVP release, contributor ignition, and UI node federation begins.

### 🌑 Phase 3 — Black Hole  
Deep protocol expansion, privacy tooling, and AI-aligned infrastructure.

- `#SignUp2`  
- `#PP`  
- `#DSM`
