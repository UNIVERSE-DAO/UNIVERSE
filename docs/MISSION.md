# 🔍 MISSION  
**The Strategic Output of UNIVERSE**

---

## 🎯 What We Are Building

UNIVERSE is not built around features — it’s built around **ethical responsibilities** encoded into protocol.  

This mission isn't about shipping a product.  
It’s about **engineering a civic layer** that aligns incentives with values, and meaning with mechanism.

Each part of the system serves a shared purpose:

- To empower ethical decision-making  
- To reveal truth through feedback, not force  
- To unlock coordination without coercion  
- To protect the integrity of individuals and collectives

In short: we’re designing the world’s most principled infrastructure — and it must function, reflect, and evolve.

- SCRS → Accountability Infrastructure  
- DAO → Governance Memes  
- UI → Visualized Truth  
- Memes → Onboarding and Meaning Transmission

- Clarity over clicks  
- Depth over daily active users  
- Alignment over virality
