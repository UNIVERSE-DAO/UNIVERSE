# COMUD – Coherence Mirror of User Dimensions

_**Taking care and responsibility of Body and Mind is one of the first steps to Master the Infinite Game.**_

---

<br>

## WHY

### COMUD invites:

* Reflection on personal well-being  
* Emotional presence signaled to the community  
* Mutual care — encouraged, never pressured  
* Resonance built from the root (Body → Mind → Social)

> _COMUD exists to remind us: **you cannot align a system without first aligning the self.**_

## WHAT

### Meaning Breakdown:

**`CO`** — Coherence, Community, Collective, Co-creation  
<sub>Inner alignment that enables meaningful connection and collaborative emergence</sub>

**`M`** — Mirror  
<sub>A ritual of self-reflection, presence, and honest signal — not performance</sub>

**`UD`** — User Dimensions 
<sub>Homage to 1990s MUDs (***Multi User Dimensions*** — pioneers of the MetaVERSE)</sub>

### User Dimensions

| # | Dimension  | Theme                  | Description                                                               |
|---|------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Body**   | Health & Comfort       | How physically at ease, energized, and rested do you feel?               |
| 2 | **Mind**   | Peace & Clarity        | How calm, clear, or mentally overloaded are you?                         |
| 3 | **Heart**  | Love & Connection      | How emotionally supported or connected do you feel with others?          |
| 4 | **Energy** | Joy & Vitality         | Do you feel motivated, alive, and internally lit — or dim and drained?   |
| 5 | **Social** | Purpose & Contribution | Are your actions aligned and meaningful — or disconnected and mechanical?|

## HOW

### The COMUD Engine is a simple tool to:

* Check in with your inner state across 5 dimensions  
* Reflect honestly — without pressure, performance, or comparison  
* Contribute your presence to collective coherence  
* Observe emerging patterns — in yourself, your season, your space  
* Activate the Support Hub when care is needed

> _A quiet rhythm of care and coherence — the mirror of collective well-being._

<br>

### Support, Help & Prevention Hub

COMUD is more than a mirror — it's one of the portals to care, support, and shared gratitude.
  
> _Sometimes, the most powerful contribution is a quiet, true story of being seen._

## Responsibility Level

By reflecting, you unlock the first level of social responsibility — also known as the [**VOW**](4.4%20VOW.md):

**_COMUD is the Mirror. VOW is the Echo._**

<br>

> _You’re not expected to be fine._  
> _You’re invited to be **true**._
