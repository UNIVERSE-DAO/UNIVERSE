### FICTION ? - ðŸŒ‘ - Black Hole of the **UNIVERSE**

<br>

**The Vision and Mission is no longer a Metaphor.**  
**Itâ€™s the Ultimate Tech for Good, the MetaCore.**

The most inclusive, immersive **MultiVERSE**,  
To guide our progress: secure and diverse.

Seems impossible â€” the noblest **FICTION**,   
Until **ALPHA** emerges to master friction.

Some will call it Trust. Some say Divide,  
The force that pulls hard our worlds aside.  

The biggest hurdleâ€™s not invention or motion,    
Itâ€™s **PUMPAMENTALS** of sociological devotion.  

Wait and see what the Black Hole absorbs & brings,  
The gravity of **UNIVERSE** will unite fragmented things.
