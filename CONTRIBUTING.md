# CONTRIBUTING to UNIVERSE

### **Join the Infinite Game — not just to build code, but to co-create a paradigm shift.**

UNIVERSE is not a typical open source project.  
It is a **symbolic protocol** — a living system for clarity, sovereignty, and collective alignment.

> You don’t need to code to contribute. You just need to care, show up with clarity, and begin.

> UNIVERSE is a movement — not just a repo. Contribution begins with culture and deepens with clarity.

## Contribution Pathways

> Contribution is a journey — from discovery to responsibility, from meme to mechanism.  
> Whether you share a symbol, write a line of code, **add poetry**, or run a node — you're helping shape the UNIVERSE.

### [The MOMENTUM Engine](#the-momentum-engine--coming-soon) — coming soon

Not a task board. A resonance interface.  
A coordination system that listens to your intent — and amplifies it across the network.

- Mirrors your energy  
- Signals your symbolic layer  
- Aligns your contribution with the protocol’s pulse  

> _A compass. A catalyst. A coordination amplifier._

> The protocol is alive — but only if it can breathe across the network.

- Host sovereign UI nodes and sync backups  
- Mirror **The Truth Engine** in other spaces  
- Translate UNIVERSE into your culture, region, or realm  

> _You don’t need to own it — you need to hold the standard._

- Read [`#UIP "UNIVERSE IMPROVEMENT PROPOSAL"`](0%20%23DAO%20-%20Layer%20Zero/0.2%20proposals/%23UIP.md)  
- Propose, co-sign, or steward protocol logic and decisions  
- Protect alignment across phases  

> _Sovereignty is expressed through aligned action._

---

<br>

> We **use** the protocol to **amplify** the protocol.  
> This isn’t just open source. It’s open **sovereignty**.  
> Every commit, every conversation, every meme — is a vote for the future.
