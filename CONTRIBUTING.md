## 🧭 Progressive Contribution Pathways

### 🌀 1. Culture & Conversation  
- Drop memes, quotes, and symbolic energy into `1 #MOMENTUM/`  
- Propose cultural frames in `MEMES.md` or GitHub Discussions  
- Host a study circle, philosophical jam, or reading club via `PHILOSOPHY.md`

---

### 📜 2. Documentation & Narrative  
- Edit or extend `.md` files inside `docs/`  
- Help refine governance, onboarding, or long-term alignment principles  
- Write with intention: poetic logic, clarity, radical inclusivity  

---

### 🛠 3. Development  
- Contribute inside symbolic modules: `4 identity/`, `5 infra/`, `3 #SCRS/`  
- Start here: [PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md](docs/PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md)  
- Use symbolic commits: [COMMIT-GUIDE.md](docs/COMMIT-GUIDE.md)  
- Follow Git rituals: [BRANCHING-STRATEGY.md](docs/BRANCHING-STRATEGY.md)

---

### 🛡 4. Protocol Governance *(Phase-Gated)*

To propose a `UIP` (UNIVERSE Improvement Proposal) or cast a governance signal:  
- You’ll need a verified Contributor ID via `#SignUp1`  
- Proposals live in [`0.2 proposals/`](0%20%23DAO%20-%20The%20Layer%20Zero/0.2%20proposals/)  
- Governance logic defined in: [`#UIP-GOVERNANCE.md`](0%20%23DAO%20-%20The%20Layer%20Zero/0.2%20proposals/%23UIP-GOVERNANCE.md)

> We **use** the protocol to govern the protocol.  
> Sovereignty is not theory — it's praxis.
