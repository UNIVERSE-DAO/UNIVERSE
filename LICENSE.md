# UNIVERSE - 4ALL

<br>

This Gift is offered, soul-aligned,  
To serve all beings — free in mind.  

Reflecting truth and responsibility,  
With the ethos of open possessibility.  

<sub>♾️</sub>

You may remix, expand, and share,  
But origin echoes beyond all snare.  

No fork or clone, no masked design,  
Can bend the truth or break the line.  

Should others try to steal or spin,  
This is — and will remain — the origin.  

<sub>♾️</sub>

Those who build with heart and aim,  
Are welcome here to tend the flame.  

But those who seek control or gain,  
Will find the mirror does not remain.

<sub>♾️</sub>

## UNIVERSE is free — but it is not directionless.  
- Use it with responsibility.  
- Act with clarity.  
- Build for eternity.
